## Usage

* Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/` to see the list of users.
* Click on a user card to view their profile details.
* Profiles display additional information including bio, birthdate, location, and posts.
* Users can create new posts, edit existing posts, and soft delete posts (posts are hidden instead of permanently removed).

---

## Notes

* This project uses Django's built-in `User` model extended with a related `Profile` model to store additional user
  information.
* User-generated content is managed through a `Post` model linked to the profiles, allowing users to share posts with
  images and captions.
* Soft delete is implemented for posts to prevent permanent data loss.
* Make sure to add profile images and cover photos in the admin panel or extend the registration flow accordingly.
